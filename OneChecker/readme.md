# OneChecker
Found this one recently on 3-31-2025 when I noticed powershell suddenly opening and closing on
one hour intervals.

It runs the following command on my machine. 
```
/c start /min "" powershell -NonInteractive -WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\(Username)\AppData\Local\reserve\red\hKrGey0H\nZwO8KCw.ps1
```

## Other notes
- Says it can't be deleted
- I can turn it off in task sheduler but then it turns itself back on.
- I did not consent to it being on my computer it just showed up randomly.
